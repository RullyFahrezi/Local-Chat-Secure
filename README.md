# Development of a Chatting Communication System with End-to-End Encryption Based on Localhost

## Project Description
This project is a chat application developed with End-to-End Encryption (E2EE), allowing users to securely send messages through a localhost server. It is built using PHP and MySQL, with key encryption for message privacy. The chat system ensures that only the sender and the receiver can decrypt and view the messages.

## Prerequisites
To get this project up and running, you'll need:
 - XAMPP (or any local PHP server)
 - PHP (Version 7.0 or higher)
 - MySQL (for the database)
